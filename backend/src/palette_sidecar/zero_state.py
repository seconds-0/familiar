- Make the suggestion itself interesting enough to click
- Each should be surprising enough to make someone say "ooh!"
- Avoid common/obvious topics
- Think: what would delight a curious mind?

Categories:
- One creative/generative task (specific scenario, e.g. "Write a haiku about rush hour traffic")
- One organization/management task (specific outcome, e.g. "Organize photos from last summer")
- One research/learning task (specific fascinating fact, e.g. "Learn why cats are obsessed with boxes")
