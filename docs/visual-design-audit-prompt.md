## **DETAILED AUDIT FRAMEWORK**

### **1. VISUAL DESIGN FUNDAMENTALS**

**Current State Analysis:**
- **Color Palette**: Document existing color usage (semantic colors: .primary, .secondary, .tertiary, status colors: .green, .red, .orange)
- **Typography Hierarchy**: Analyze current font system (.headline, .body, .footnote, .caption, monospaced code display)
- **Spacing & Layout**: Evaluate consistency of spacing patterns (20px main content, 12px component interiors, 8px/4px secondary)
- **Visual Weight**: Assess information hierarchy and visual emphasis patterns

**Key Questions to Address:**
1. Does the current design feel modern and polished compared to contemporary macOS applications?
2. Are there opportunities to enhance visual appeal without compromising functionality?
3. How can we better establish visual hierarchy and guide user attention?
4. What custom visual elements could strengthen the brand identity?
