## Steel Thread Status

This is the minimal MVP (steel thread) implementation. Currently supports:
- âœ… Reading files and directories via MCP filesystem server
- âœ… Natural language understanding with Claude Code SDK
- âœ… Streaming responses with proper message type handling
- âœ… Per-directory session persistence
- âœ… Permission system with canUseTool callback
- âœ… Visual icons for better UX
- âœ… Proper error handling

Coming next:
- ðŸš§ File editing capabilities (Edit, Write tools)
- ðŸš§ Command execution (Bash tool)
- ðŸš§ Progressive trust levels
- ðŸš§ Claude.ai login support
- ðŸš§ Additional MCP servers (git, search)

## Architecture

Built with:
- Raycast API for the UI
- Claude Code SDK for AI capabilities
