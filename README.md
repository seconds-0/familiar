# Claude for macOS (Native App)

> ðŸš§ **Project Status**: Architecture Planning Phase
> Designing a native macOS application that delivers Claude Code end-to-end

## Vision

Build a focused macOS companion that unlocks Claude Code's full capabilities through a global command palette and native integrations. The app should feel instantaneous, respect local guardrails, and make advanced automation approachable for every workspace.

## Why Native?

Embedding Claude Code directly into a macOS app removes sandbox and subprocess limitations. Native control means:
- âœ… Full Claude Code SDK access with streamlined tool permission flows
- âœ… Direct subprocess spawning for MCP servers and shell actions
- âœ… First-class filesystem integration for editing and diffing
- âœ… Tight coupling with macOS input, windows, and menu bar surfaces
- âœ… Real-time process oversight without IPC overhead

## Planned Features

### Core Functionality
- **Global Hotkey**: Cmd+Cmd for instant access
- **Complete Claude Code SDK**: Every tool, including Bash and MCP servers
- **Process Management**: Live logs, cancellation, and retries
- **Rich UI**: Markdown rendering, syntax highlighting, diff viewers

### User Experience
- Menu bar entry point with status insights
- Floating command palette that respects the active workspace
- Progressive trust and permission audit trails
- Conversation history scoped per project directory

## Technology Options Under Consideration

### Option 1: Electron
- Full Node.js runtime for SDK integration
- Mature ecosystem and cross-platform potential

### Option 2: Tauri
- Slim bundle footprint backed by Rust
- Security-forward architecture with WebView UI

### Option 3: Swift + Node Bridge
- Deep macOS integration and native feel
- Requires bridging for Node-based tooling
