- **Exa Service**: Complete API client with cost controls and intelligent caching
- **Research Tools**: Specialized capabilities for SwiftUI, macOS, and architecture patterns
- **Claude Integration**: Automatic prompt enhancement with relevant search results

#### Technical Approach:

```python
# Cost-controlled semantic search with caching
class ExaService:
    async def semantic_search(self, query: str, domain_focus: str = None)
    async def code_search(self, query: str, languages: List[str] = None)
    async def research_enhancement(self, user_prompt: str, context: str)
```

#### User Modifications:

User made intentional changes to config files removing some Exa integration, which were noted and respected.

### 3. Claude Agent SDK Model Optimization Research

**Request**: Research selective Haiku usage for minor tasks (RESEARCH ONLY)
**Duration**: Final phase of session
**Status**: ðŸ”„ In Progress (interrupted for this summary)

#### Key Findings:

- **Single Model Limitation**: Claude Agent SDK enforces one model per session
- **No Dynamic Switching**: Cannot change models mid-conversation
- **Available Models**: Haiku (fast/cheap), Sonnet (balanced), Opus (premium)
- **Current Implementation**: Exclusively uses Sonnet

#### Research Insights:

The SDK's architecture prevents runtime model switching, but multi-client patterns could enable selective model usage through task classification and routing.

## Technical Concepts Explored

### Visual Polish Workflow Automation

**Key Learning**: Comprehensive toolchain covering design capture â†’ annotation â†’ optimization â†’ accessibility

`â˜… Insight â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€`
The visual polish workflow revealed the importance of command-line automation for design handoff. Tools like shot-scraper and gifsicle enable pixel-perfect documentation that bridges design and implementation phases.
`â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€`

### Semantic Search Integration Architecture

**Key Learning**: Exa's neural search capabilities provide context-aware research enhancement

`â˜… Insight â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€`
The Exa integration demonstrated how semantic search can enhance AI prompts by automatically injecting relevant technical documentation and patterns, creating a self-improving research loop.
`â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€`

### AI Model Selection Strategy

**Key Learning**: Task classification enables cost optimization across different model capabilities

`â˜… Insight â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€`
The Claude Agent SDK's single-model constraint highlighted the need for intelligent task routing. Simple queries could use Haiku's speed while complex analysis leverages Sonnet's reasoning.
`â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€`

## Problem-Solving Patterns

### 1. Tool Acquisition Challenges

**Problems Encountered**:

- Network timeouts during batch Homebrew installations
- Package name confusion (shot-scraper vs pixelmatch-cli)

- Explicit PATH verification and configuration

### 2. Integration Architecture Decisions

**Challenge**: Balancing feature richness with cost control
**Solution**: Implemented tiered research enhancement with caching and rate limiting

**Challenge**: Maintaining backwards compatibility with existing Claude service
**Solution**: Extended existing patterns rather than replacing core functionality
